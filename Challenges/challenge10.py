# Write Python code to perform the repeated addition .
# Use a for loop, and augmented assignment, to give answer the result of multiplying number by multiplier
#multiply 5 eight times but by adding using augmented assignment

number = 5
multiplier = 8
answer = 0

for i in range(multiplier):
    answer+=5
